Welcome to Techkriti 2019: Cyber Security Workshop. This repository contains the real Android malware sample. This hands-on session mainly deals with static analysis techniques to identify security flaws in an Android App or extracting useful information from the malware samples.

## Tools Required

**1. MobSF :** In this session, we are going to use a web-based open source framework (MobSF) to analyzing a sample (malware/benign). To make hand-on faster, we have hosted this framework on the IITK network only for this session and can be accessed on the URL [https://cseproj91.cse.iitk.ac.in:5555/](https://cseproj91.cse.iitk.ac.in:5555/).
